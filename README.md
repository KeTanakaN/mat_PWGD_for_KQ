Matlab programs for a point-wise gradient descent method for kernel quadrature

These are Matlab programs for generating points for kernel quadrature by a point-wise gradient descent method. These programs are used to yield the results of the numerical experiments in the article "Kernel quadrature by applying a point-wise gradient descent method to discrete energies". 

Below are the descriptions of the program files.
